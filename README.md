# Initial development environment for Mac OS

This document describes how I have set up my developer environment on a new MacBook. 

I have setup mainly for 
- Node 
- Python 
- Mobile Application development on android & iOS using React Native
- ASP.NET Core

As you read and follow these steps, feel free to send me any feedback or comments you may have.

The document assumes you are new to Mac. The steps below were tested on OS X High Sierra.

- System Update (#system-update)
- Install developer browsers(#install-web-browsers)
- ITerm2

## System Update 

First thing you need to do, on any OS actually, is update the system! For that: Apple Icon > Software Update

## Install Web Browsers 

I use both chrome and firefox. I need chrome for any react native development and firefox for all the web development and testing

So go ahead and grab both of them. 

If you are a newbie like me to Mac and don't know how to install an application, then just drag and drop the app to Applications.

## ITerm2 
Lot of work happens only on terminal. ITerm2 is a nice terminal which has loads of capabalities. Go ahead and install it.

## Atom

## VS Code

## Homebrew

## Git

    $ brew install git

when done check 

    $ git --version

also test,

    $ which git

the output must be /usr/local/bin/git


## Python


## Node

Install Node.Js from Homebrew

    $ brew update
    $ brew install node
